This is a "just for fun" open source Chrome extension which gets a random dad joke at a customizable time interval. Want to hear a corny dad joke a few times a day? This extension is for you.

If this project brightens your day, consider making a donation to
the [Chicago Food Bank](https://www.chicagosfoodbank.org/financial-support/"), an organization + mission of which I am very supportive.

## Tutorial

Interested in learning how to build your own Chrome extension or how this one was made? It's on my wishlist to provide a tutorial. Star this repo to get automatically updated / give me extra motivation to finish it up.

## Special Thanks

This project was made using the very awesome, much appreciated [Icanhazdadjoke API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/)
